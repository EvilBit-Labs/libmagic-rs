# Performance Optimization

> **Note**: Performance optimizations are planned for future releases. This documentation describes the optimization strategies and targets.

libmagic-rs is designed for high performance while maintaining safety and correctness.

## Performance Targets

- **Speed**: Within 10% of C libmagic performance
- **Memory**: Comparable memory usage to C implementation
- **Startup**: Faster initialization with rule caching
- **Scalability**: Efficient handling of large files and rule sets

## Optimization Strategies

### Memory-Mapped I/O

- Avoid loading entire files into memory
- Leverage OS page cache for frequently accessed files
- Zero-copy buffer operations where possible

### Rule Evaluation

- Lazy evaluation: only process rules when necessary
- Early termination on definitive matches
- Optimized rule ordering based on match probability

### String Matching

- Aho-Corasick algorithm for multi-pattern searches
- Boyer-Moore for single pattern searches
- Binary-safe string operations

### Caching

- Compiled rule caching to avoid re-parsing
- Result caching for frequently analyzed files
- Intelligent cache invalidation

## Benchmarking

Performance benchmarks will be available using the `criterion` crate:

```bash
cargo bench
```

## Profiling

Tools for performance analysis:

- `cargo flamegraph` for CPU profiling
- `valgrind` for memory analysis
- `perf` for detailed system-level profiling
