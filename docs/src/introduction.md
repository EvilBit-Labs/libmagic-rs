# Introduction

Welcome to the **libmagic-rs** developer guide! This documentation provides comprehensive information about the pure-Rust implementation of libmagic, the library that powers the `file` command for identifying file types.

## What is libmagic-rs?

libmagic-rs is a clean-room implementation of the libmagic library, written entirely in Rust. It provides:

- **Memory Safety**: Pure Rust with no unsafe code (except vetted dependencies)
- **Performance**: Memory-mapped I/O for efficient file processing
- **Compatibility**: Support for standard magic file syntax and formats
- **Modern Design**: Extensible architecture for contemporary file formats
- **Multiple Outputs**: Both human-readable text and structured JSON formats

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Early Development Phase** - The project is currently in active development with core components being implemented.

### What's Complete

- âœ… **Core AST Structures**: Complete data model for magic rules with full serialization
- âœ… **Parser Components**: Numbers, offsets, operators, and values parsing with nom
- âœ… **Memory-Mapped I/O**: FileBuffer implementation with memmap2 and comprehensive safety
- âœ… **CLI Framework**: Command-line interface with clap and basic file handling
- âœ… **Project Infrastructure**: Build system, strict linting, and comprehensive testing
- âœ… **Extensive Test Coverage**: 98 comprehensive unit tests covering parser, AST, and I/O
- âœ… **Memory Safety**: Zero unsafe code with comprehensive bounds checking
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Structured error types with proper propagation and context
- âœ… **Code Quality**: Strict clippy linting with zero-warnings policy

### What's In Progress

- ðŸ”„ **Complete Magic File Parser**: Full rule parsing with hierarchical structure support
- ðŸ”„ **Rule Evaluation Engine**: Offset resolution, type interpretation, and operators
- ðŸ”„ **Output Formatters**: Text and JSON result formatting with metadata

### Next Milestones

- ðŸ“‹ **Parser Integration**: Combine parsing components into complete magic file parser
- ðŸ“‹ **Basic Evaluator**: Simple rule evaluation against file buffers
- ðŸ“‹ **Result Formatting**: Human-readable and structured output generation
- ðŸ“‹ **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow validation

## Why Rust?

The choice of Rust for this implementation provides several key advantages:

1. **Memory Safety**: Eliminates entire classes of security vulnerabilities
2. **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions and efficient compiled code
3. **Concurrency**: Safe parallelism for processing multiple files
4. **Ecosystem**: Rich crate ecosystem for parsing, I/O, and serialization
5. **Maintainability**: Strong type system and excellent tooling

## Architecture Overview

The library follows a clean parser-evaluator architecture:

```text
Magic File â†’ Parser â†’ AST â†’ Evaluator â†’ Results â†’ Formatter
                              â†“
                        Target File Buffer
```

This separation allows for:

- Independent testing of each component
- Flexible output formatting
- Efficient rule caching and optimization
- Clear error handling and debugging
